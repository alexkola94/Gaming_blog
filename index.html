    <h1 class="display-1 first-title">2022 has not wasted any time.</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Whether because of shifting release calendars, less reliance on the
      retail sphere, or delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months
      of 2022 have become a perfect storm of video game release mayhem.
      We’ve wandered The Lands Between. We’ve deciphered secret languages.
      We’ve explored 31st-century America. And although we’re out of the
      thick of the hectic release schedule, we’re still coming across the
      occasional hidden gem or two, and returning to the games that were too
      huge to finish the first time around. So, we’ve taken it upon
      ourselves to help you separate the wheat from the chaff — to recommend
      our favorite games from the slew of ambitious titles that release as
      the months go by. We’ll be updating this page throughout the year,
      with the most recent releases toward the top, so you can stay up to
      date with all of the excitement (or at least, as up to date as
      possible).

        <h5 class="card-title  title">TINY TINA’S WONDERLANDS</h5>
        <p class="card-text">With Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, it feels as if Borderlands’ developers
          are finally comfortable letting go, and the results speak for
          themselves. Wonderlands is a joyful romp through
          tabletop-RPG-inspired worlds, with seemingly minor tweaks that
          create huge ripples in the series’ “Diablo meets guns” formula. You
          can combine two disparate character classes, traverse a board-game
          style overworld, and pour dozens of hours into the phenomenal “Chaos
          Chamber” endgame. Through it all, Gearbox is willing to acknowledge
          that we’re not here for a script, or even a coherent narrative, and
          it leans into that sentiment with an appropriately scattershot story
          — it doesn’t take itself so seriously that it sacrifices
          unpredictability, joy, or the satisfaction of mesmerizing, well
          earned loot. <i>—Mike Mahardy</i></p>

        <h5 class="card-title title">NORCO</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Norco stands out for a lot of reasons: It’s a beautiful, honest
          portrayal of southern Louisiana, an inventive and dystopian
          science-fiction story, and a sharp criticism of the oil industry’s
          blight. Created by Geography of Robots, Norco is an interpretation
          of Norco, Louisiana — the real town whose name stands for the New
          Orleans Refining Company, home to Shell’s manufacturing complex. As
          a point-and-click adventure, Norco unravels slowly as the main
          character, Kay, returns to her childhood home following her mother’s
          death. It’s all at once a magical realism story with mystery
          elements, yet still firmly rooted in a sense of reality — not an
          easy blend of genres to balance. The writing and simple
          environmental puzzles, together with a unique mind-map mechanic that
          acts as a character list and mental notebook, lend to a fast-paced
          story that still leaves room to stop and take in all of the poignant
          weirdness. <i>—Nicole Carpenter</i></p>

        <h5 class="card-title title">TUNIC</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Some games thrive on meaningful obfuscation. Tunic is one of them.
          There are echoes of Myst, The Witness, and the original Legend of
          Zelda in developer Andrew Shouldice’s action-adventure outing. It
          has also drawn myriad comparison to 2012’s Fez, a game which also
          deployed its own unique written language to confuse, entice, and
          ultimately steer players toward its larges overarching secrets. Its
          combat can become cloying — especially during later boss fights —
          and its level design doesn’t always allow for the most leisurely
          backtracking. But its willingness to trust the player’s
          intelligence, patience, and most of all, thirst for discovery make
          it a masterful adventure in its own right. <i>—Mike Mahardy</i></p>

        <h5 class="card-title title">ELDEN RING</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Numerous games have tried to emulate the explorative wonder of 2017’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,
          but Elden Ring is the first game to truly succeed. With a landscape that will take years to fully decipher, it
          is every bit the kind of game we’ve come to expect from developer From Software: mysterious, impenetrable, and
          ultimately rewarding. But its open-world trappings reframe much of the brutality of those games, and don’t
          detract from their challenges, but rather, encourage incremental progress over brute force. It’s not uncommon
          to get lost in a far corner of the map for a dozen hours, only to return to a previous challenge as a
          completely new character, with stronger powers and newfound wisdom at your disposal. This game is a marvel.

        <h5 class="card-title title">DESTINY 2: THE WITCH QUEEN</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Destiny has been through a lot since 2014: rocky release days, a global pandemic, and a
          sale to PlayStation, to name a few of its many obstacles. So it’s almost a miracle that, eight years along,
          Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is the best thing to ever happen to the series. With a new campaign, a new
          location, new weapons, and new powers, it’s more Destiny, to be sure. But it’s also Destiny without the
          qualifiers, or the conversations that are spoken with not a small amount of yearning: “Imagine how good this
          would be if Bungie did X, Y or Z?” Bungie has spent the past few years building on the potential of its
          massive experiment, and with The Witch Queen, it’s finally paying off. <i>—Ryan Gilliam</i></p>

        <h5 class="card-title title">TOTAL WAR: WARHAMMER 3</h5>
        <p class="card-text">There are ambitious games, and there are ambitious games. Total War: Warhammer 3 is the
          latter. Its map is bigger than those of its predecessors combined, and it launched with eight fantasy
          factions, each stranger and more grandiose than the last. It’s also exceedingly weird, and refuses to rest on
          its laurels as the strategy trilogy wraps up, instead pushing the envelope wherever it can. It transports
          players to ethereal Chaos Realms before warping them back to their homelands to battle diseased goliaths and
          shapeshifting demon lords. It is as far from a safe third installment as we’ve seen since Hitman 3. And if the
          DLC road map for Total War: Warhammer 2 was any indication, the next few years will get even weirder. <i>—Mike

        <h5 class="card-title title">HORIZON FORBIDDEN WEST</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The sequel to 2017’s excellent post-apocalyptic Horizon Zero Dawn is already one of the
          year’s best. Horizon Forbidden West takes so much of what made the first game great, and gives players more to
          work with: more settlements, weapons, and traversal options. It starts a bit slow, and can take a while to
          introduce some of its more creative gadgets — but it gets better and better as you unlock more tools for your
          arsenal. By the end, Aloy can glide off mountains, swim the deepest seas, and explore American landmarks along
          the west coast. This game’s gorgeous open world feels like a gift, and it’s easy to sink hours into exploring
          every gorgeous corner. Meanwhile, the character writing and world-building convey a civilization well worth
          saving. <i>—Nicole Clark</i></p>

        <h5 class="card-title title">DYING LIGHT 2</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The immersive payoff in Dying Light 2 Stay Human requires a rather stiff time investment.
          The plodding story pacing isn’t helped by some of the reversals and outright nullifications that can happen
          later, either. But the game’s first-person parkour and combat gameplay are stand-up delights. However much
          time you choose to spend in the vast, locked-down city of Villedor, you won’t be bored by any of it. And, as a
          role-playing game, Aiden Caldwell evolves into a fascinating and powerful character, thanks to multiple
          storyline branches, decisions that have irrevocable consequences, and two perk trees that make his athletic
          capabilities even more exciting to see, let alone do for yourself. <i>—Owen S. Good</i></p>

        <h5 class="card-title title">POKÉMON LEGENDS: ARCEUS</h5>
        <p class="card-text">To say that Pokémond Legends: Arceus was a long time coming would be an understatement. In
          fact, I’ve fully embraced the Dunkey joke that this is actually the second Pokémon game ever made. It
          gracefully streamlines so many of the series’ tedious aspects (the mere act of catching Pokémon in real time
          is now satisfying as hell) that it’s a wonder Game Freak hasn’t tried this before. It’s also the first game in
          which I actually care about filling out the Pokédex, complete with each creature’s challenges and research
          tasks. It feels less like a hamfisted series of turn-based battles, and more like a contemplative, sometimes
          terrifying adventure into the wilderness to sate my collector’s appetite. <i> —Mike Mahardy</i></p>
