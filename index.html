        <h1 class="display-1">2022 has not wasted any time.</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Whether because of shifting release calendars, less reliance on the
          retail sphere, or delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months
          of 2022 have become a perfect storm of video game release mayhem.
          We’ve wandered The Lands Between. We’ve deciphered secret languages.
          We’ve explored 31st-century America. And although we’re out of the
          thick of the hectic release schedule, we’re still coming across the
          occasional hidden gem or two, and returning to the games that were too
          huge to finish the first time around. So, we’ve taken it upon
          ourselves to help you separate the wheat from the chaff — to recommend
          our favorite games from the slew of ambitious titles that release as
          the months go by. We’ll be updating this page throughout the year,
          with the most recent releases toward the top, so you can stay up to
          date with all of the excitement (or at least, as up to date as
          possible). We’ll also be doing the same for the best movies, the best
          anime, and the best TV shows of 2022.

            With Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, it feels as if Borderlands’ developers
            are finally comfortable letting go, and the results speak for
            themselves. Wonderlands is a joyful romp through
            tabletop-RPG-inspired worlds, with seemingly minor tweaks that
            create huge ripples in the series’ “Diablo meets guns” formula. You
            can combine two disparate character classes, traverse a board-game
            style overworld, and pour dozens of hours into the phenomenal “Chaos
            Chamber” endgame. Through it all, Gearbox is willing to acknowledge
            that we’re not here for a script, or even a coherent narrative, and
            it leans into that sentiment with an appropriately scattershot story
            — it doesn’t take itself so seriously that it sacrifices
            unpredictability, joy, or the satisfaction of mesmerizing, well
            earned loot. <i>—Mike Mahardy</i>

          <p class="card-text">
            Norco stands out for a lot of reasons: It’s a beautiful, honest
            portrayal of southern Louisiana, an inventive and dystopian
            science-fiction story, and a sharp criticism of the oil industry’s
            blight. Created by Geography of Robots, Norco is an interpretation
            of Norco, Louisiana — the real town whose name stands for the New
            Orleans Refining Company, home to Shell’s manufacturing complex. As
            a point-and-click adventure, Norco unravels slowly as the main
            character, Kay, returns to her childhood home following her mother’s
            death. It’s all at once a magical realism story with mystery
            elements, yet still firmly rooted in a sense of reality — not an
            easy blend of genres to balance. The writing and simple
            environmental puzzles, together with a unique mind-map mechanic that
            acts as a character list and mental notebook, lend to a fast-paced
            story that still leaves room to stop and take in all of the poignant
            weirdness. <i>—Nicole Carpenter</i>

          <p class="card-text">
            Some games thrive on meaningful obfuscation. Tunic is one of them.
            There are echoes of Myst, The Witness, and the original Legend of
            Zelda in developer Andrew Shouldice’s action-adventure outing. It
            has also drawn myriad comparison to 2012’s Fez, a game which also
            deployed its own unique written language to confuse, entice, and
            ultimately steer players toward its larges overarching secrets. Its
            combat can become cloying — especially during later boss fights —
            and its level design doesn’t always allow for the most leisurely
            backtracking. But its willingness to trust the player’s
            intelligence, patience, and most of all, thirst for discovery make
            it a masterful adventure in its own right. <i>—Mike Mahardy</i>

            Numerous games have tried to emulate the explorative wonder of
            2017’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but Elden Ring is
            the first game to truly succeed. With a landscape that will take
            years to fully decipher, it is every bit the kind of game we’ve come
            to expect from developer From Software: mysterious, impenetrable,
            and ultimately rewarding. But its open-world trappings reframe much
            of the brutality of those games, and don’t detract from their
            challenges, but rather, encourage incremental progress over brute
            force. It’s not uncommon to get lost in a far corner of the map for
            a dozen hours, only to return to a previous challenge as a
            completely new character, with stronger powers and newfound wisdom
            at your disposal. This game is a marvel. <i>—Mike Mahardy</i>

            Destiny has been through a lot since 2014: rocky release days, a
            global pandemic, and a sale to PlayStation, to name a few of its
            many obstacles. So it’s almost a miracle that, eight years along,
            Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is the best thing to ever happen to the
            series. With a new campaign, a new location, new weapons, and new
            powers, it’s more Destiny, to be sure. But it’s also Destiny without
            the qualifiers, or the conversations that are spoken with not a
            small amount of yearning: “Imagine how good this would be if Bungie
            did X, Y or Z?” Bungie has spent the past few years building on the
            potential of its massive experiment, and with The Witch Queen, it’s
            finally paying off. <i>—Ryan Gilliam</i>

            Warhammer 3 is the latter. Its map is bigger than those of its

            each stranger and more grandiose than the last. It’s also
            exceedingly weird, and refuses to rest on its laurels as the
            strategy trilogy wraps up, instead pushing the envelope wherever it
            can. It transports players to ethereal Chaos Realms before warping
            them back to their homelands to battle diseased goliaths and
            shapeshifting demon lords. It is as far from a safe third

            The sequel to 2017’s excellent post-apocalyptic Horizon Zero Dawn is
            already one of the year’s best. Horizon Forbidden West takes so much
            of what made the first game great, and gives players more to work
            with: more settlements, weapons, and traversal options. It starts a
            bit slow, and can take a while to introduce some of its more
            creative gadgets — but it gets better and better as you unlock more
            tools for your arsenal. By the end, Aloy can glide off mountains,
            swim the deepest seas, and explore American landmarks along the west
            coast. This game’s gorgeous open world feels like a gift, and it’s
            easy to sink hours into exploring every gorgeous corner. Meanwhile,

            The immersive payoff in Dying Light 2 Stay Human requires a rather
            stiff time investment. The plodding story pacing isn’t helped by
            some of the reversals and outright nullifications that can happen
            later, either. But the game’s first-person parkour and combat
            gameplay are stand-up delights. However much time you choose to
            spend in the vast, locked-down city of Villedor, you won’t be bored
            by any of it. And, as a role-playing game, Aiden Caldwell evolves

            storyline branches, decisions that have irrevocable consequences,
            and two perk trees that make his athletic capabilities even more

            mere act of catching Pokémon in real time is now satisfying as hell)
            that it’s a wonder Game Freak hasn’t tried this before. It’s also
